to make a repo...
First, I used cd to get into github-learning
Then, I used mkdir repotest to create the directory
After that, I used touch README.md, then c9 README.md to enter the file and type in it
Next, I went over to github and created the repository repotest because the names need to be the same
Then, I used git init and added the message "How I created a repo"
Finally, I copied the lines for pushing an existing repository from the command line
